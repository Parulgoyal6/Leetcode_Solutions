# Leetcode_Solutions
1.👩‍💻 Versatility Across Languages:-
Solved problems in Java (back-end and OOP challenges), SQL (database querying and manipulation), DSA (fundamental algorithms), and JavaScript (web-based algorithms and asynchronous tasks).

2.🔎 Performance Optimization: Focused on optimizing time and space complexity, especially for large datasets and database queries using indexing, joins, and efficient algorithms.

3. 📖Comprehensive DSA Knowledge: Proficient in data structures (arrays, trees, hash maps) and algorithms (dynamic programming, backtracking, graph traversal) for efficient problem-solving.

4.🚀 Real-World Applications: Applied JavaScript for dynamic web solutions and SQL for practical database management, demonstrating how solutions translate to real-world projects.

5. 🧪Test-Driven Development: Emphasized robustness by considering edge cases and input constraints, validating solutions with unit tests in Java and JavaScript.
